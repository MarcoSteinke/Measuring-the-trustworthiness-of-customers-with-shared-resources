# Measuring the trustworthiness of customers with shared resources

## Introduction:
This repository will discuss an algorithm which can be used to find metrics which allow a teacher to measure which customers do not share his/her materials by signing payments and requests on the material. 

By signing both, a set of small trees can be generated for each resource (= material, e.g. slides or a video URL).

This method will not be 100% accurate due to changing devices by the customer and multiple requests on the same resources. There may be possibilities to weight the metric by a factor which estimately represents the customers request behaviour with a resource.
